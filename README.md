# Solid-Waste-Classification

In the recent times, I have started attaching so much importance to responsibly segregating solid waste. The necessity to segregate waste properly into recyclables and organics is very crucial for our planet. If all the waste ends up in landfills, those that cannot be decomposed will remain as a huge toxin affecting the surroundings and the living beings. 

I have started segregating recyclables, organics and hazardous materials into appropriate bins at my house and eventually dump them into their respective bins in common areas. But I have always had a feeling that the awareness of proper waste disposal still needs to improve. As a techie, I knew I could contribute something to ease the process of identifying a material as recyclable or organic. 

In this project, I have come up with an image classification model which identifies a given image as the image of an organic or recyclable item respectively. When I first embarked on this project, I wanted to collect my own data from my own phone and the internet. But I came across an amazing dataset on Kaggle for waste classification consisting of household waste. The dataset is divided into 22564 training images and  2513 test imaages for two classes namely, Organic and Recyclable. I have experimented using a basic Convolutional Neural Network as well as a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (VGG) to perform this classification task.
